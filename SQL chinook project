SELECT firstname, lastname, email, customerid, country FROM customers
WHERE Country != 'USA'

--Show only the Customers from Brazil

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, customerid, country FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'


--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country

SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.billingcountry FROM invoices i
INNER JOIN customers c
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId

--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Agent%'


--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table

SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry FROM invoices

--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name

SELECT i.invoiceid, e.firstname, e.lastname from invoices i
INNER JOIN customers c ON c.customerid = i.customerid
INNER JOIN employees e ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid

--Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT i.total, c.firstname, c.lastname, i.billingcountry, e.firstname AS 'employee_first_name', e.lastname from invoices i
JOIN customers c ON c.customerid = i.customerid
JOIN employees e ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid

--How many Invoices were there in 2009

SELECT * from invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '%2009%'


--What are the total sales for 2009

SELECT ROUND(SUM(total),2) AS total_sales from invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '%2009%'


--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID

SELECT t.name, n.invoiceid from tracks t
JOIN invoice_items n ON n.trackid = t.trackid

--Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID

SELECT t.composer, t.name, n.invoiceid from tracks t
JOIN invoice_items n ON n.trackid = t.trackid

INNER JOIN albums a ON a.albumid = t.albumid
INNER JOIN media_types m ON m.mediatypeid = t.mediatypeid
INNER JOIN genres g ON g.genreid = t.genreid

SELECT ROUND(SUM(i.total),2), e.firstname, e.lastname FROM invoices i
INNER JOIN customers c on c.customerid = i.customerid
INNER JOIN employees e on e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
GROUP BY e.firstname


--Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS total, e.firstname, e.lastname FROM invoices i
INNER JOIN customers c on c.customerid = i.customerid
INNER JOIN employees e on e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '%2009%'
